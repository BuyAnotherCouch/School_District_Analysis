# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
Maria, a chief data scientist for a city school district, requires assistance in analyzing data on student funding and student standardized test scores. Our task is to organize the data and illustrate trends in school performance.

## Results
Using the student funding, and math and reading scores, we were able to output the following results:
-	Top 5 Performing Schools

-	Bottom 5 Performing Schools
-	Math Scores by Grade
-	Reading Scores by Grade
-	Scores by School Spending
-	Scores by School Size
-	Scores by School Type
During our analysis, it was brought to our attention that the ninth grade reading and math scores were not accurate. Therefore, we replaced all the ninth grade scores with NaN values.
